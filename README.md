# websocket-nodejs

## Description:

This repository contains a basic Node.js application for testing WebSocket communication. It provides a starting point for WebSocket server and client implementations using the popular "ws" library. You can use this code to learn how to set up WebSocket connections, exchange messages, and build real-time applications in Node.js.

## Features:

- WebSocket server and client examples.
- Minimalistic code for establishing WebSocket connections.
- A foundation for building real-time applications, chat apps, and more.
- Easy-to-understand code comments for learning and customization.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Explore the server and client code in separate directories.
4. Run the server and client code to establish WebSocket connections.
5. Start experimenting and building real-time features.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/websocket-nodejs.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd websocket-nodejs
3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
4. Explore the __server__ and **client** files for WebSocket server and client implementations.
5. Start the WebSocket server:
    ```
    node server.js
6. Start the WebSocket client (in a separate terminal or browser for a front-end client):
    ```
    node client.js
7. Navigate to the project directory:
